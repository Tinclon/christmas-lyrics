Hark how the bells, 
sweet silver bells, 
all seem to say, 
throw cares away

Christmas is here, 
bringing good cheer, 
to young and old, 
meek and the bold.

Ding dong ding dong 
that is their song 
with joyful ring 
all caroling.

One seems to hear 
words of good cheer 
from everywhere 
filling the air.

Oh how they pound, 
raising the sound, 
o'er hill and dale, 
telling their tale.

Gaily they ri-ing, while people si-ing 
Songs of good che-er, Christmas is here.

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas, 
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas.

On on they send, 
on without end, 
their joyful tone 
to every home.
Ding dong ding... dong!
