Little Toy Trains

Little toy trains, little toy tracks
Little toy drums, comin' from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed

Close your eyes, listen to the skies
All is calm, all is well
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells

Bringin' little toy trains and little toy tracks
Little toy drums, comin' from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed

So, close your eyes and listen to the skies
All is calm, all is well
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells

Bringin' little toy trains and little toy tracks
Little toy drums, comin' from a sack
Carried by a man dressed in white and red
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed
