Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say on a bright Hawaiian Christmas day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway

Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright
The sun will shine by day and all the stars at night

Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas to you

Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas,
A very Merry Christmas, a very, very, very Merry Merry Christmas to you
